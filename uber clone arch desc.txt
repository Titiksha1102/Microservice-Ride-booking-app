Uber clone application within three different microservices as follows
- Users Microservice
- Captain Microservice
- Rides Microservice
Each service runs on separate container and has its own db

Other components that help in communication between these microservices include:
- Message broker queue
- Web socket server

A user creates a ride request using the create ride endpoint in rides microservice
and pushes the ride req to queue.
The captain dashboard subscribes to the queue via a web socket connection and listens to rides persistently
The different pages in frontend include:
User login
User signup
User ride booking page(user home)

Captain login

Captain dashboard(new ride requests obtained from queue appear here)
